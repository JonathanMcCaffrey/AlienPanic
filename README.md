#### COMMITS AND PUSH #####
The **Scene conflicts** will always be there if multiple developers are working on the same scene. 
**Solution 1:** Please create prefabs as much as possible or else data will be lost (depending on what you choose to resolve conflicts). 
**Solution 2:** Make sure you modify scene stuff after you rebase / merge your local copy just before committing and pushing to master (if possible).
